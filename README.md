# Introduction

Welcome to BitMart trader and developer documentation. These documents outline exchange functionality, market details, and APIs.

APIs are separated into two categories: trading and feed. Trading APIs require authentication and provide access to placing orders and other account information. Feed APIs provide market data and are public.

**By accessing the BitMart Market Data API, you agree to be bound by the** [**Market Data Terms of Use**](https://support.bitmart.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004890354-Terms-of-Use).
